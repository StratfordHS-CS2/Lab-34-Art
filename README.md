# Lab 34 - Art

You will be using Pygame to draw a scene of your choice.  Use the drawing functions reference document to help you remember how to draw each shape.  You can draw whatever you want (house, car, person, trees, etc.), but it does have to meet some minimum criteria.

Your drawing must:
* Use at least one each of Line, Circle, Rectangle, Polygon (triangle, pentagon, etc.), Text, and at least one of Ellipse or Arc.
* The picture should be a coherent image, not just a collection of random shapes.  I'm not judging artistic ability.  It is ok to have multiple separate drawings, like a snowman, a house, and a face.
* Have a non-black background color.
* Each shape should have a color.  Use a variety of colors.  At least some shapes must be filled with color.
